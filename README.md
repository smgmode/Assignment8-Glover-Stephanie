I had problems with this commands
```
<p>**$git commit**  -> it wasn't committing my file changes properly, so I had to use **$git commit -m "message"** to make all my commits with messages.</p>

I need help with merging this branch
**Merging**
I merged the **new-section** branch, but I had trouble merging the **styling** branch.

It would *open* like it was going to merge -> turned to *sleep mode* like this at the top of the git terminal:
glovparis-sleep git merge styling.
